    "From the readme file, a cost of increased reproduction in terms of reduced longevity has been shown for female fruitflies, but not for males.\n",
    "The flies used were an outbred stock.\n",
    "Sexual activity was manipulated by supplying individual males with one or eight receptive virgin females per day.  \n",
    "The longevity of these males was compared with that of two control types.\n",
    "The first control consisted of two sets of individual males kept with one or eight newly inseminated females.\n",
    "Newly inseminated females will not usually remate for at least two days, and thus served as a control for any effect of competition with the male for food or space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second control was a set of individual males kept with no females. \n",
    "There were 25 males in each of the five groups, which were treated identically in number of anaesthetizations (using CO2) and provision of fresh food medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has 125 observations and 5 variables"

    "\n",
    "Seaborn is a library for making attractive and informative statistical graphics in Python. \n",
    "It is built on top of matplotlib and tightly integrated with the PyData stack, including support for numpy and pandas data structures and statistical routines from scipy and statsmodels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the features that seaborn offers are:\n",
    "  * Several built-in themes that improve on the default matplotlib aesthetics\n",
    "  * Tools for choosing color palettes to make beautiful plots that reveal patterns in your data\n",
    "  * Functions for visualizing univariate and bivariate distributions or for comparing them between subsets of data\n",
    "  * Tools that fit and visualize linear regression models for different kinds of independent and dependent variables\n",
    "  * Functions that visualize matrices of data and use clustering algorithms to discover structure in those matrices\n",
    "  * A function to plot statistical timeseries data with flexible estimation and representation of uncertainty around the estimate\n",
    "  * High-level abstractions for structuring grids of plots that let you easily build complex visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn should be thought of as a complement to matplotlib, not a replacement for it. \n",
    "When using seaborn, it is likely that you will often invoke matplotlib functions directly to draw simpler plots already available through the pyplot namespace. \n",
    "Further, while the seaborn functions aim to make plots that are reasonably “production ready” (including extracting semantic information from Pandas objects to add informative labels), full customization of the figures will require a sophisticated understanding of matplotlib objects.\n",

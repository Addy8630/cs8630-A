    "# Population Pyramid\n",
    "\n",
    "Population pyramids provide a graphical comparison of two histograms, where each side of the pyramid is one of a two-factor divsion of a data set.\n",
    "It usually consists of two back-to-back histograms, with the population plotted on the X axis and age on the Y axis.\n",
    "The most common division is the Male and Female partitioning.\n",
    "Males are conventionally shown on the left and females on the right, measured in frequency or density (%) of population.\n",

    "In the example above, we see population histograms for Libya in 2011.\n",
    "Another name for this plot is an _age pyramid_, as the buckets are typically age ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the result of these back-to-back histograms form a pyramid shape, particulary when the population is growing. \n",
    "Population pyramids are often viewed as the most effective way to graphically depict the age and sex distribution of a population, partly because of the very clear image these pyramids represent."

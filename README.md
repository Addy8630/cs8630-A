Introduction to Visualization Tech
Wicham grammar of graphics makes us understand that a good dataset has compenents that are well described in the data, this graph from the State of Missouri is well labelled, the x axis shows the years over which unemployment has progressed or evolved, whereas the y axis tells us about the percentage over the years. Historical data can be seen in the graph and this makes it easy for us to compare to other States over time as well.
